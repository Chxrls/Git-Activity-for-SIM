1. What challenges did you face during this activity?
	> I faced no challeges during the activity since I am already familiar with working with the command line and git. It was a breeze

2. Which Git command was the most confusing?
	> Using git flags, there are alot of flags in git and it gets confusing quickly. I wish these flags were documented more thoroughly.

3. How can version control help in real-world software development?
	> Version control like git is essential in software-development cause it enables for collaboration between multiple developers within the use of branching,
	allowing them to work on a single project simultaneously without overwriting each other's changes. Version Control also tracks changes within the project,
	every single modification is recorded allowing developers to track who made changes to the codebase.
